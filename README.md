# RPS
A rock paper scissors game to learn the use of javascript

Jan 24th - First function finished. The function randomly selects a number between 0-2 and that represents one of R/P/S. 

Jan 24th Edit# 2 - I wrote out the framework for comparing choices. Still need to deal with capitalization and incorrect entries. 

Jan 25th Edit #3 - The single round RPS is finished. Also fixed the capitalization and incorrect entries. Had issues because I wasn't using === but I sorted that out. Next up I need to make a game function that runs everything 5 times. 

Jan 27th Edit #4 _ I cleaned up some of the code and created two new functions "gameInputs" which ran the original functions together and "game" which counted the score and ended the game once someone reached 3. I also altered the playRound function so that it added points for the player or the computer depending on the result.
