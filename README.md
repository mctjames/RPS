# RPS
A rock paper scissors game to learn the use of javascript

Jan 24th - First function finished. The function randomly selects a number between 0-2 and that represents one of R/P/S. 
Jan 24th Edit# 2 - I wrote out the framework for comparing choices. Still need to deal with capitalization and incorrect entries. 
Jan 25th Edit #3 - The single round RPS is finished. Also fixed the capitalization and incorrect entries. Had issues because I wasn't using === but I sorted that out. Next up I need to make a game function that runs everything 5 times.
